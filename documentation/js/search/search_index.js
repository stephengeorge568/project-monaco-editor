This issue is best illustrated with a simple example:\n\t\n\t\n\t\tIn this example we have two clients: Amy and Bob. They are editting a document that currently sas \"abc\" as the \n\t\tdocument model. Amy enters the character '@' at the beginning of the document. On her screen, she will see \n\t\tthe document model update to \"@abc\". Her change to the document will then be sent to Bob's client, however it will take awhile for the message to travel to him.\n\t\tAt near the same time, Bob inserts character '%' at the beginning of the \n\t\tdocument. Bob's document model will now read as \"%abc\". Bob's change will then be sent to Amy's document.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tWhen Amy's change finally arrives to Bob, it sees that Bob's document model is \"%abc\". Remember that Amy's change \n\t\twas insert '@' at the beginning of the document, or index 0. When Amy's change is applied to Bob's document, Bob's final document model is \"@%abc\".\n\t\tHowever, when Bob's initial change of insert '%' to the beginning of the document arrives and is applied to Amy's document, Amy ends up with a document state of \"%@abc\".\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAmy and Bob's documents are now different.

This issue is best illustrated with a simple example:\t\t\t\tIn this example we have two clients: Amy and Bob. They are editting a document that currently sas \"abc\" as the \t\tdocument model. Amy enters the character \\'@\\' at the beginning of the document. On her screen, she will see \t\tthe document model update to \"@abc\". Her change to the document will then be sent to Bob\\'s client, however it will take awhile for the message to travel to him.\t\tAt near the same time, Bob inserts character \\'%\\' at the beginning of the \t\tdocument. Bob\\'s document model will now read as \"%abc\". Bob\\'s change will then be sent to Amy\\'s document.\t\t\t\tWhen Amy\\'s change finally arrives to Bob, it sees that Bob\\'s document model is \"%abc\". Remember that Amy\\'s change \t\twas insert \\'@\\' at the beginning of the document, or index 0. When Amy\\'s change is applied to Bob\\'s document, Bob\\'s final document model is \"@%abc\".\t\tHowever, when Bob\\'s initial change of insert \\'%\\' to the beginning of the document arrives and is applied to Amy\\'s document, Amy ends up with a document state of \"%@abc\".\t\t\t\tAmy and Bob\\'s documents are now different. This is considered a confliction in the document state and is why managing real-time document editting systems is difficult.\t\t'\n    var COMPONENTS = [{'name': 'AppComponent', 'selector': 'app-root'},{'name': 'CreateDocumentComponent', 'selector': 'app-create-document'},{'name': 'DocumentInfoComponent', 'selector': 'app-document-info'},{'name': 'EditorComponent', 'selector': 'app-editor'},{'name': 'FooterComponent', 'selector': 'app-footer'},{'name': 'HomeComponent', 'selector': 'app-home'},{'name': 'HowItWorksComponent', 'selector': 'app-how-it-works'},{'name': 'MonacoComponent', 'selector': 'app-monaco'},{'name': 'OpenDocumentComponent', 'selector': 'app-open-document'},{'name': 'ToolbarComponent', 'selector': 'app-toolbar'},{'name': 'WelcomeComponent', 'selector': 'app-welcome'}];\n    var DIRECTIVES = [];\n    var ACTUAL_COMPONENT = {'name': 'HowItWorksComponent'};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"components/MonacoComponent.html":{"url":"components/MonacoComponent.html","title":"component - MonacoComponent","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n  Components\n  \n  MonacoComponent\n\n\n\n        \n            Info\n        \n        \n            Source\n        \n        \n            Template\n        \n        \n            Styles\n        \n        \n            DOM Tree\n        \n\n\n\n    \n    File\n\n\n    src/app/components/monaco/monaco.component.ts\n\n\n\n    \n        Description\n    \n    \n        Wrapper component for the editor.

Users can create documents and edit those documents with anyone that can access a browser. The editor supports features like cloud save, downloading the file, syntax highlighting, some simple intellisense, and more! \nHow to use\n\nDownload code. \nDownload Docker. \nPerform command ‘docker build –t ot-editor .’ on root folder \nPerform command ‘docker run -p 80:80 ot-editor'\n\nOr, to local host, simply download Node, Angular CLI, and run ‘ng serve’ \nRelease Notes\nSeptember 2022: Only one document at a time can be supported. Some minor bugs with operational transformation process. UI experience is bad with no styling and no features besides editting.\nOctober 2022: Generalization nearly complete. Multiple documents can be created, and mulitiple documents can be editted at once. Documents can be opened and editted. No way to save document model. Styling on pages is making progress.\nNovember 2022: Generalization complete. Filesystem cloud saves enabled. Minor bug fixes. Styling on pages complete. Error handling displayed to user on wrong password requests for example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
